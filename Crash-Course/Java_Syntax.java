//Java is an Object Oriented programming Language which allows for code to be written once and ran on any platform.
//OOP Languages have concepts unique to them such as Encapsulation, polymorphism, Inheritance and much more but then the major default OOP concept Java utilizes is Encapsulation.
//Java Encapsulates It's main body of code in classes which could be public, privated or protected, we'd delve into those later.
//The class name due to javas syntax has to be the same as the file name hence why our class is namde
//We have functions and for our code to compile and run we need to have a main function; Our main function is in line 9, that is where our code starts executing from.
//If you notice, there's a pattern of arrangement in which the Class encapsulates the main function and the main function encapsulates the code body, this is called a tree.
// On line 10 we have our first line of non-boiler plate code which is a print statement for Hello Planet Earth
//NB: JAVA IS A STRONGLY TYPED LANGUAGE WHICH MEANS CAPITALIZATION MATTERS, SEMICOLONS AND PUNCTUATION MARKS MATTERS AND HAVE MEANINGS, THEY WOUD BE DELVED IN AS WE MOVE
public class Java_Syntax {// This is a class in java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Planet Blue");
